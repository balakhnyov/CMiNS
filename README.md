## General info
This project made mainly for investigate processes of conductors' scattering in some nanoparticles film samples, basing on experimental data.
	
## Methods
In this project I will use following techniques:
* Quantum mechanics
* Solid state physics
* Stochastic methods (like Monte Carlo method)

## Modules
### Geometry
### Kinetics
